excerpt: "Anxiety Self Help is a personal guide and journal of self-help resources I have experienced during my attempts to recover from anxiety disorders. Starting with my review of The Chimp Paradox, I use this website to document my experiences of professionally-recommended anxiety self-help resources."

Anxiety Self Help is my personal project to document my experiences using self-help tools that have been recommended to me by UK healthcare professionals. Significantly, I focus on self-help because my mental health concerns are not serious enough to warrant NHS counselling or pharmaceutical interventions. You must always seek professional medical advice before using any resources that I mention.

For the first few days, I will need to focus on configuring this website to operate as I want it to. Then I will start describing my experiences with the first resource that my doctor has recommended - a book called The Chimp Paradox. Later, I may introduce other resources that my doctor mentioned. Including locally managed online and group therapy.
